_For I Have Stood On The Shoulders Of Giants_

This started life as a fork of bediger4000's [kilo-in-go](https://github.com/bediger4000/kilo-in-go). 

I have some thoughts on what a text environment can look like based on my experiences with Vim (my first love) and [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs), plus some ideas I find interesting from Plan9's Acme editor.
